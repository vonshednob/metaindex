# Changelog

This file contains the changes made between released versions.

The format is based on [Keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) and the versioning tries to follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

## Not released yet
### Changed
- Use [PyPDF](https://pypi.org/project/pypdf/) instead of pdfminer for PDF indexing
- `OCRFacility.run` can be given a language to work with to prevent guessing
- Collection and side-car files are processed first now, instead of last to allow defining languages
- The optional `callback`, that can be used to inspect the status of the indexer, sees the un-`reduce`d `CacheEntry`. Makes it more useful for testing rule indexers and such.
- Timestamp-like occurrences (like `filetags.date`) have been split into `.date` and `.time`. You can search each respectively with `date:` or `time:`

### Added
- `OCRFacility` can be queried for supported languages
- Another level of verbosity when indexing: `-vvvvv`, prints also all found metadata

### Fixed
- Server could crash when read-only connections were made and the cache directory doesnâ€™t exist yet
- Some code duplication removed for writing YAML and JSON sidecar files

## 0.8.0
### Added
- `bulk_rename` operation in `MemoryCache`.
- Implemented `forget` in all caches

### Fixed
- When querying all sidecar files for a file, metaindex would return the file itself, when asking this for a sidecar file (odd scenario, still bad)


## 0.7.1
### Fixed
- `find_all_sidecar_files` would not return *all* sidecar files (ignoring those that are not writable)
- `General.ignore-dirs`, as documented, is now actually considered

### Changed

- Function to insert a whole set of new files in the MemoryCache

## 0.6.0
### Added
- Function to iterate through all sidecar files of a file

## 0.5.0
### Added

  matches

### Changed
- API for `Indexer` changed slightly
- `stores.get`, `stores.get_for_collection` accept byte streams, too

### Removed
- `add`, `remove`, and `edit` commandline parameters are gone. Use
  metaindexmanager for these functions instead
